        1. make sure the spreadsheet looks the same OR BETTER than the original one
        2. implement the MVP 
            2.1 having the mechanic automatically update based on selection
            2.2 have a new spreadsheet saved in the proper location
        3. Add extra functions so the mechanic never has to open the spreadsheet
        4. have it work mostly without flaws
        5. well documented readme
