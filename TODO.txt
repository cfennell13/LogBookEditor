List of functionality in order of priority:
    priority is based on:
        1. make sure the spreadsheet looks the same OR BETTER than the original one
        2. implement the MVP 
            2.1 having the mechanic automatically update based on selection
            2.2 have a new spreadsheet saved in the proper location
        3. Add extra functions so the mechanic never has to open the spreadsheet
        4. have it work mostly without flaws
        5. well documented readme


''' DONE''' add pictures for the airplane, engine, and prop

''' DONE''' RESERACH TASK
    formatting with openpyxl??
    will probably need to do some VBA??
    Formatting required:
        formatting for some of the keywords in the excel sheet:
            bold: 100 Hr, Airframe, Engine, Propeller,
            Bold and blue: prop #, engine #, airframe #
            bold and red: any serial numbers (start with S/N)
    Formatting is completed through a macro that runs when the user opens the file
    

''' DONE''' Change the mechanic to the proper name based on their selection in the drop down

''' DONE''' Add tach time label for inputting tach times

''' DONE''' insert today's date into the logfile

''' DONE'''Set the dropdown default to the last used mechanic

''' DONE'''add biweekly functions
    add a biweekly dropdown 
    write the biweekly to the file (only needs to be done once, it should propagate by itself
    save the biweekly in the shelf file to default on the most recently use biweekly 
    
display all the warnings on the final page
    the columns on the far right show the recurring items
    read in all the items and show them on the GUI
    
let the user update the warnings from the gui
    have the user select/change the warnings that need to be changed
    write the new values to the new spreadsheet
    
   
handle the exception that is thrown when the user tries to write a file that is already open in excel
    this will likely never happen except in testing but should be handled anyway

let the user specify the path to the planes on start for the first time
    need to have a user imput
    need it saved into the shelve file 
    need to read it everytime from the shelve file
